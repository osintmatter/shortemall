## Scope
Short 'Em All! is a CLI tool that allows analysts to do lookups of URLs generated by almost every Url Shortener vendor out there.
You can generate custom URLs based on your custom dictionary or input keywords, check for active links containing one or more words (with any permutations), and get screenshots of the content on them.
Short' Em All!, finally, allows you to get a .txt report with active url's for single scan and related keywords.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of Python

1. go to: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads, download the driver version of your locally installed chrome - browser version. Then put it into /Driver folder.
1. go to /input folder and populate stable\_dict.txt with one word per line -- these will be the words that will be permutated and appended to the generated custom URLs
1. go to /Short\_Em\_All: python3 short\_em\_all.py
## Options
