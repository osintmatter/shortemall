## Scope
*Short 'Em All!* is a Python tool that allows analysts to do lookups of URLs generated by almost every Url Shortener Service out there.
You can generate custom URLs based on your custom dictionary or input keywords, check for active links containing one or more words (with any possible permutation automatically generated), and get screenshots of the content on them.
Short' Em All!, finally, allows you to get a .txt report with active url's for single scan and related keywords.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Python - pip (at least v. 3.8)

2. Insert the chrome driver file path into the config.ini file on Drivers:" " line.
