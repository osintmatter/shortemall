 ## **:link: SHORT'EM ALL!:link:** v0.1
 
by OSINTMATTER 
 
## Scope
*Short 'Em All!* is a Python tool that allows analysts to do lookups of URLs generated by almost every Url Shortener Service out there.
You can generate custom URLs based on your custom dictionary or input keywords, check for active links containing one or more words (with any possible permutation automatically generated), and get screenshots of the content on them.
Short' Em All!, finally, allows you to get a .txt report with active url's for single scan and related keywords.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Python (at least v. 3.8) 
* You run the tool on Linux machine

## Installing
1. Run config.py to automatically generate path variables
1. Open terminal on /shortemall/ and run: pip install -r requirements.txt
1. Go to: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads, download the driver version of your locally installed chrome - browser version. 
2. Insert the chrome driver file path into the config.ini file on Drivers:" " line.
3. Go to /input folder and populate stable\_dict.txt with one word per line -- these will be the words that will be permutated and appended to the generated custom URLs
4. Go to /Short\_Em\_All, and on terminal run: python3 short\_em\_all.py

## CLI Options

usage: short_em_all.py [-h] [-t TARGET] [-s [SCREENSHOT]] [-v [VERBOSE]]

optional arguments:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET

  -v [VERBOSE], --verbose [VERBOSE]
                        turn on verbose mode
